# Crypted_Cloud_Storage

This is a project of a cloud storage that I made in team with Salvatore Cortis. It was committed for the university exam "Applied Cryptography" and it implements a cloud storage with the requisite of guaranteeing confidentiality, authentication, and protection against replay during the communication between client and server. I share it here to show an example of my abilities in criptography and C++ language.
